This is a beach resort app that allows you to search through various hotel rooms based on the customers' needs. It's a react app that I created in the "React Courses and Tutorials" course on udemy. You can narrow your search of rooms by room type, number of guests, price, room size, and if the room includes breakfast or allows pets.
